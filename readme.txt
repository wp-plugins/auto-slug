This plugin generates unicode slug from title You're writing and replaces %postname% part of permalink.

== Description ==

Simply write title to a post and You'll see that it automagicaly makes slug from title.

History:
I was searching for plugin that will ease the process of making posts.
Writing same thing twice (first title, second slug for title in permalink) is like a hell when You've to write many posts a day.
So I decided to make the plugin that will generate slug-string-for-permalink automatically.

Result: pretty simple and useful plugin. 

Hope You'll enjoy it.

Sincerely,
Anar Jafarov (a.k.a. num8er)
